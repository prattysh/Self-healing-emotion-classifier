# Self-Healing Text Classifier (ATG Assignment)

This project is a command-line based Emotion Classifier powered by a fine-tuned DistilBERT model with efficient LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters. It detects emotions like joy, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and love from natural language input. 

What makes this system unique is its "self-healing design" — implemented using a LangGraph-based DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) — that can intelligently fall back or reclassify when confidence is low. This enables more robust, real-time emotion detection even in uncertain cases.

Built with:
-  Transformers (`distilbert-base-uncased`)
-  LoRA (PEFT) for lightweight fine-tuning
-  LangGraph for self-healing inference flow
-  PyTorch backend for fast inference
-  CLI for direct user interaction

The model is fine-tuned on emotion-labeled text data and can be used in real-world scenarios like chatbots, social media monitoring, or sentiment-aware recommendation systems.

## How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train the Model

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This saves the LoRA fine-tuned model to `./model/fine_tuned`.

### 3. Run the CLI

```bash
python Cli.py
```

### 4. Run Batch Test Cases

```bash
python test_cases.py
```

This runs 10 sample emotional inputs and prints their predicted labels and confidence scores.

##  Training Summary

```json
{
  "train_loss": 0.664,
  "eval_loss": 0.434,
  "train_runtime": "3.3 hours"
}
```

TensorBoard logs are stored in `./logs/` and can be visualized if needed.

---

## Supported Labels

- sadness
- joy
- love
- anger
- fear
- surprise

---

##  Notes

- `logs/` folder contains TensorBoard events
- `model/fine_tuned/` must exist before running CLI
